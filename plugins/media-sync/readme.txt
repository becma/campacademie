Simple plugin to scan "uploads" directory and bring those files into Media Library.

== Description ==

You can scan all files that are in `uploads` directory and see which ones are actually in Media Library and which ones are just sitting there. Then you can select files you want to import to the database and therefore make them available in Media Library.

You can also use FTP to upload your files to `uploads` directory and bring those files into Media Library. 


= Disclaimers =

Please read before adding a support topic. Reviews are not intended for support or suggestions.

1.  "For developers"
    This plugin makes database changes (`wp_posts` and `wp_postmeta` tables), and it was primarily developed to help other developers that are aware of the consequences.

2.  "1 file first"
    Please be careful and try to import only one file first, to see if it works.

3.  "All at once"
    This plugin is focused on scanning, selecting, and importing all files at once. So it might not be great for huge amounts of files, since it can use up a lot of memory. Future versions will hopefully solve that problem. For now, you can try to go to Settings -> Media Sync and set it to scan only a specific directory.

4.  "Your setup is unique"
    Please keep in mind that each WordPress installation is unique, so it's quite possible this plugin will not work in your case. If that happens, please turn on debugging in settings of this plugin, try to figure out why you have that problem, and then describe what you found in the Support section. The more details we have - it's more likely the problem will be solved.


= Ignored files =
- index.php,
- various hidden files (.DS_Store, .htaccess),
- WP generated thumbnails (files ending with for example -100x100.jpg),
- WP generated scaled images (files ending with -scaled),
- optimized .webp versions of original images (.jpg.webp),
- retina thumbnails (-100x100@2x.jpg).

This is now configurable with a custom hook function and it can totally overwrite [these rules](https://regex101.com/r/FeIIvs/1) or add additional ones.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `media-sync` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Stuck at importing / spins endlessly =

Please try to increase `max_execution_time` (and/or `memory_limit`) in `php.ini` on server (as described [here](https://thimpress.com/knowledge-base/how-to-increase-maximum-execution-time-for-wordpress-site/)). Or if you have too many files, try going to Settings -> Media Sync and change "Scan directory" to some inner folder.

= Files not showing up in Media Library =

Please make sure "Dry Run" option is NOT checked. This is a safety mechanism to make sure you know what you're doing, so be careful, try it first with just one file.

= Doesn't work =

Please first try to turn on debugging in Settings -> Media Sync and check [Network tab in Chrome DevTools](https://www.section.io/blog/chrome-developer-tools-tutorial-network/) to see what is going on in the background. Then report actual errors since it's hard to help without knowing the error which is causing the problem.


== Changelog ==

= 1.3.1 =
* Ignore optimized .webp versions of original images (e.g. .jpg.webp) and retina thumbnails (e.g. -100x100@2x.jpg) by default. It's still possible to customize it with `media_sync_filter_is_scan_object_ignored` hook.

* Minor code cleanup.
* Update supported WordPress version to 6.2.
